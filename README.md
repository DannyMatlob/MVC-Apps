# MVC-MineField

The MVC Framework is a framework that allows for easy customization of new applications that have a Model, View, and Controller.
Currently only one customization is in this repo: the Minefield customization. 

Minefield is a spinoff of the popular game Minesweeper. It can be played by downloading and running Minefield.java.
